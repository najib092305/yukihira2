        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! My name is Najib C. Amatonding. I’m a person who loves learning, creating, and sharing stories about my life and experiences. It all started one thing you should know about me is that I really enjoy learning new things, especially when it comes to numbers and problem-solving. My favorite subject is Math because it challenges my mind and helps me think logically. I like solving equations and figuring out answers then it feels like solving a mystery!

Aside from academics, I also love playing sports. My favorites are badminton, chess, and volleyball. Badminton keeps me active and fast, while chess helps me think strategically. Volleyball, on the other hand, is where I enjoy teamwork the most. Through these games, I’ve learned about focus, patience, and cooperation.

When I’m not studying or playing sports, I like spending time with my friends, listening to music, and exploring new things that make me happy. I believe that balance between studying and having fun is important. I always try to do my best and enjoy every moment whether I’m solving a math problem or hitting the shuttlecock on the court.</p>
